# bmd-hdsdi-rtr

Node.js web server to control and monitor Blackmagic HD-SDI Video routers. 
This is a work in progress.  
- you'll need to edit server.js to set ip address for your blackmagic hardware.



# setup instructions
```
npm install
mpm run build
npm start
```

# to-do list
- add rollup-plugin-babel to dev-dependencies for transpiling
- add some linting.  I'm self taught so my code is sloppy.  
- add a means to set router's ip address as a command line flag or by entering from the client.
- add a means to hide unwanted destinations on client page
